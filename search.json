Nous allons ici nous intéresser aux deux premiers cas. Le package {laeken} fournit un fichier d’exemple de l’enquête SILC (survey income living condition). Nous pouvons prendre ce fichier comme exemple, et venir créer un numéro d’enquêteur-rice à partir de la variable de province DB040. Nous exécutons la fonction runVizsurvey_from_r avec comme argument supplémentaire var_group = \"DB040\" afin de prévoir des subdivisions du travail de terrain par province. Si vous avez lancé les packages nécessaires, une interface shiny doit se lancer dans votre navigateur, et afficher cette carte de chaleur. Celle-ci est le coeur du fonctionnement de vizsurvey, car elle permet de naviguer de manière interactive à travers les situations détectées comme anormales.  Chaque ligne est un ou une enquêtrice. Ici, nous reconnaissons les provinces australiennes avec un index, issu de notre simulation de numéro. Chaque colonne est une variable, catégorielle ou continue. Chaque cellule est colorée si les réponses de l’enquêteur-rice pour cette variable est suffisamment différentes des réponses du reste de la base de données. Pour les variables catégorielles, il peut s’agir d’un écart trop important sur le pourcentage de données manquantes, ou d’un χ²\\chi² trop élevé (donc d’une distribution très éloigné du reste de la base de données) ; Pour les variables numériques, il peut s’agir d’un écart trop important sur le pourcentage de données manquantes, ou d’une écart trop important sur la médiane. Eu survolant les cellules, toutes les informations sont affichées, de sorte à comprendre la source de la coloration. Voici une première manière d’analyser la carte de chaleur : Une cellule isolée “chaude” n’est pas problématique en soi — avec beaucoup de croisements, il est normal d’observer quelques extrêmes. Une ligne largement “chaude” (plusieurs variables) évoque un comportement récurrent (erreur de procédure, incompréhension, routage mal appliqué, voire fraude). Une colonne “chaude” (plusieurs enquêteur-rices) pointe une variable fragile (libellé ambigu, routing, aide à l’enquêteur, effet d’une zone). Dans notre exemple, plusieurs cellules s’allument en rouge pour la région de Vienne. En cliquant sur le croisement Vienne-1 / HHSIZE, peut afficher la distribution de cette variable HHSIZE pour l’enquêteur Vienne-1, et le comparer avec la distribution de cette variable pour les autres. découvre ainsi que le pourcentage de modalités 3 et 4 sont bien plus présent chez les autres que chez l’enquêteur Vienne-1.  Ici, remarque que les 5 lignes de Vienne sont allumées en rouge, preuve d’un effet de zone plutôt qu’un effet d’enquêteur·rice. Pour s’en convaincre, peut sélectionner DB040 = Vienne en haut de l’interface. Dès lors, la carte de chaleur se limite aux données de Vienne, et n’affiche que les écarts des enquêteur-rices par rapport à cette province. Il n’y plus aucune cellule s’affichant en rouge ainsi.  Lorsqu’clique sur une variable numérique, la fonction de densité s’affiche alors, toujours avec le point de comparaison. Voici un exemple pour la variable d’âge pour l’enquêtrice Carinthia-5 :","code":"knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE) library(vizsurvey) library(laeken) data(eusilc) set.seed(123) eusilc <- eusilc %>%    mutate(NR_ITW = paste(db040,sample(1:5,nrow(.), replace = T),sep=\"-\")) runVizsurvey_from_r(eusilc,var_itw = \"NR_ITW\",var_group = \"db040\")"},{"path":"https://tdelc.github.io/vizsurvey/articles/vizsurvey.html","id":"pas-à-pas-volet-enquêteurs","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Lancement vizsurvey","what":"Pas à pas — volet enquêteurs","title":"Explorer et contrôler vos données d’enquête avec **vizsurvey**","text":"Sélectionner l’enquête et la période (ex. semaine N, vague t).
