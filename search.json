Comme expliqué dans la première vignette, {vizsurvey} n’pas pour objectif de réaliser des tests statistiques ou de conclure : il s’agit avant tout d’un outil d’exploration et de diagnostic, positionné entre la collecte et l’analyse des données dans le cycle du GSBPM. Les calculs réalisés dans {vizsurvey} reposent sur des mesures simples mais robustes, telles que les distances, les rangs, les écarts types ou les écarts relatifs entre distributions. Ces mesures servent de repères visuels pour identifier d’éventuelles incohérences : variations anormales d’une vague à l’autre, écarts entre enquêteur·rices, changements brusques de distribution ou hausses inattendues du taux de non-réponse. L’ensemble des fonctions utilisées dans {vizsurvey} été conçu pour être applicable à tout type de variable, qu’elle soit catégorielle (codes, modalités, réponses à choix) ou numérique (valeurs continues, durées, âges, revenus). L’objectif est de fournir un cadre de calcul générique, reproductible et robuste, permettant d’assurer la comparabilité des résultats entre enquêtes, années ou domaines. La priorité est donnée à la stabilité des indicateurs et à la simplicité des formules, afin de faciliter leur lecture et leur appropriation par les équipes de terrain. Ces choix méthodologiques ne sont pas figés : ils ont été progressivement affinés au sein de Statbel, sur base des premiers résultats produits par l’interface. Les retours d’expérience des responsables d’enquête, les échanges entre services, ainsi que plusieurs références issues de la littérature sur la qualité des enquêtes ont guidé l’évolution des fonctions. La publication de ce package vise à partager ces choix. En rendant publiques les formules, les fonctions et la logique de calcul, nous souhaitons favoriser la transparence, encourager la réutilisation et stimuler les contributions d’autres équipes confrontées à des problématiques similaires. Notre ambition est de construire, avec d’autres instituts de statistique et organismes de sondage, une base commune d’outils et de pratiques pour le monitoring des enquêtes. Les exemples fournis dans cette vignette se basent sur la base de données eusilc du package {laeken}.

SILC permet notamment de calculer des indicateurs clés comme le taux de pauvreté le celui de privation matérielle et sociale.

Ici, nous reconnaissons les provinces autrichiennes avec un index, issu de notre création d’un numéro d’enquêteur·rice. Chaque colonne est une variable, catégorielle ou continue. Chaque cellule est colorée si les réponses de l’enquêteur·rice pour cette variable est suffisamment différente des réponses du reste de la base de données. Pour les variables catégorielles, il peut s’agir d’un écart trop important sur le pourcentage de données manquantes, ou d’un χ²\\chi² trop élevé (donc d’une distribution très éloignée du reste de la base de données). Pour les variables numériques, il peut s’agir d’un écart trop important sur le pourcentage de données manquantes ou sur la médiane. Dans les deux cas, ces écarts sont normalisés par variable avant affichage, et la cellule s’affiche si l’écart dépasse cinq écarts-types pour cette variable. Le détail méthodologique sur les calculs effectués se trouve dans une vignette dédiée. En survolant les cellules, toutes les informations sont affichées, de sorte à comprendre la source de la coloration. Voici une première manière d’analyser la carte de chaleur : Une cellule isolée rouge n’est pas problématique en soi : avec beaucoup de croisements, il est normal d’observer quelques extrêmes. Une ligne régulièrement rouge (sur plusieurs variables) évoque un comportement récurrent (erreur de procédure, incompréhension, routage mal appliqué, voire fraude). Une colonne rouge (sur plusieurs enquêteur·rices) pointe une variable fragile (libellé ambigu, routing, effet d’une zone). Par défaut, la carte de chaleur affiche une cellule en rouge lorsque l’un des écarts dépasse 5 écart-type de la variable. Dans notre situation, cela conduit à afficher 7 cellules, toutes pour Vienne. En réduisant le seuil de sensibilité dans les paramètres, affiche bien plus de cellules. Il n’y pas de seuil prédéterminée, ou statistiquement valide, pour une telle analyse. Cela doit être déterminé par tâtonnement par l’équipe en charge de la coordination de l’enquête. Il est également possible de modifier le nombre de lignes minimum (donc d’enquêtes) pour afficher la ligne, ou le nombre de valeurs non manquantes nécessaires pour l’affichage d’une cellule. Enfin, il est possible de zoomer dans la carte de chaleur, sur les lignes, les colonnes, ou sur les cellules à risque. Cela permet, lorsque la carte de chaleur est trop vaste, de cibler plus efficacement les situations à analyser.

Un résumé statistique de la variable est disponible en dessous à l’aide du package summarytools. découvre ainsi que les modalités 3 et 4 de la variable HHSIZE sont bien moins présentes chez l’enquêteur Vienne-1 que chez les autres. Pour essayer de comprendre ces différences, nous avons inclus un algorithme qui calcule les dix corrélations les plus hautes dans la base de données, pour ensuite projeter les corrélations effectives pour l’enquêteur·rice et celles du reste de la base de données. Il s’agit uniquement de corrélations de pearson en transformant au préalable les variables catégorielles en facteur. Principe directeur : aucun test statistique n’est effectué. {vizsurvey} calcule des distances, des scores, des rangs et des corrélations destinés à prioriser la revue. Les conclusions analytiques restent du ressort de l’équipe méthodologique. Pour notre enquêteur Vienne-1 et son résultat surprenant pour la variable HHSIZE, observe que les corrélations de cette variable sont identiques chez lui et pour le reste de la base de données. Cela semble écarter l’hypothèse d’une anomalie spécifique à cette variable.  Pour revenir sur la carte de chaleur, remarque que les cinq cellules de Vienne sont allumées en rouge pour la variable HHSIZE, preuve d’un effet de zone plutôt qu’un effet d’enquêteur·rice. Pour s’en convaincre, peut sélectionner DB040 = Vienne en haut de l’interface.

La méthode Isolation Forest est une technique d’apprentissage automatique non supervisée utilisée pour établir un classement de rareté des observations. Elle repose sur une idée simple : les observations inhabituelles sont plus faciles à isoler que les observations “normales”. Concrètement, l’algorithme construit de nombreux arbres de décision aléatoires : à chaque nœud, une variable et une valeur de coupure sont choisies au hasard pour diviser l’échantillon. Une observation est isolée lorsqu’elle se retrouve seule dans une branche. Les observations anormales nécessitent donc moins de divisions pour être isolées. Le score d’isolation obtenu peut ensuite être utilisé pour établir un rang. Important : ce classement n’est pas une preuve. Il priorise l’audit (lecture ciblée des variables responsables, vérification du contexte terrain). Voici le classement des enquêteur·rices issue de la carte de chaleur. retrouve enquêteur·rices de province de Vienne, mais aussi d’autres de la province de la basse et la haute Autriche. Pour ces deux derniers cas, il n’y pas d’écarts au dessus du seuil de sensibilité, mais l’isolation se fait rapidement.  En cliquant sur un·e enquêteur·rice, obtient un deuxième tableau à droite avec la liste des variables. Voici l’illustration en cliquant sur l’enquêtrice Vienna-4.

L’interprétation des résultats doit toujours s’appuyer sur le contexte opérationnel : les consignes données aux enquêteur·rices, les conditions de collecte, etc. Ces éléments seuls permettent de distinguer une vraie anomalie d’un simple effet de structure ou de calendrier. De plus, les informations mobilisées concernent parfois des données sensibles, tant sur les enquêteur·rices que sur les ménages interrogés ; elles doivent donc être traitées dans le strict respect des règles de confidentialité et de protection des données personnelles en vigueur. En résumé, {vizsurvey} est un outil d’aide à l’analyse, pas un outil de diagnostic automatique.
