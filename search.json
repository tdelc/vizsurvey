Les questions portent sur des thèmes variés : la politique, la confiance dans les institutions, le bien-être, la religion, le travail, la santé, etc. L’ESS est une enquête en face à face, réalisée auprès d’un échantillon représentatif de la population adulte (à partir de 15 ans). Chaque pays participant suit un protocole commun très strict pour garantir la comparabilité internationale. Les données sont rendues publiques et servent à la recherche en sciences sociales, à la comparaison entre pays et à l’analyse des évolutions dans le temps. Nous fournissons deux vagues d’enquêtes : ESS9 et ESS10. L’EU-SILC est une enquête annuelle coordonnée par Eurostat. Elle sert à mesurer les revenus, la pauvreté, les inégalités et les conditions de vie dans les pays européens. SILC permet notamment de calculer des indicateurs clés comme le taux de pauvreté le celui de privation matérielle et sociale. C’est une enquête auprès des ménages, menée par les instituts nationaux de statistique (comme Statbel en Belgique). Eurostat fournit publiquement des Public Use Files, des fichiers utilisables publiquement pour des tests. Les fichiers sont anonymisées et ne reproduisent pas nécessairement les résultats officiels.

Pour les variables catégorielles, il peut s’agir d’un écart trop important sur le pourcentage de données manquantes, ou d’un χ²\\chi² trop élevé (donc d’une distribution très éloigné du reste de la base de données). Pour les variables numériques, il peut s’agir d’un écart trop important sur le pourcentage de données manquantes, ou d’un écart trop important sur la médiane.

Une ligne largement rouge (plusieurs variables) évoque un comportement récurrent (erreur de procédure, incompréhension, routage mal appliqué, voire fraude).

Par défaut, la carte de chaleur affiche une cellule en rouge lorsque les écarts dépassent 5 écarts-types de la variable. Dans notre situation, cela conduit à afficher 7 cellules, toutes pour Vienne. En réduisant le seuil de sensibilité dans les paramètres, affiche bien plus de cellules. Il n’y pas de seuil prédéterminée, ou statistiquement valide, pour une telle analyse. Cela doit être déterminé par tâtonnement par l’équipe en charge de la coordination de l’enquête.

La méthode Isolation Forest est une technique d’apprentissage automatique non supervisée utilisée pour établir un classement de rareté des observations. Elle repose sur une idée simple : les observations inhabituelles sont plus faciles à isoler que les observations normales. Concrètement, l’algorithme construit de nombreux arbres de décision aléatoires : à chaque nœud, une variable et une valeur de coupure sont choisies au hasard pour diviser l’échantillon. Une observation est isolée lorsqu’elle se retrouve seule dans une branche. Les observations anormales nécessitent donc moins de divisions pour être isolées. Le score d’isolation obtenu peut ensuite être utilisé pour établir un rang. Important : ce classement n’est pas une preuve. Il priorise l’audit (lecture ciblée des variables responsables, vérification du contexte terrain, contrôle croisé avec le suivi qualité). Voici le classement des enquêteur-rices issue de la carte de chaleur. retrouve enquêteur-rices de province de Vienne, mais aussi d’autres de la province de la basse et la haute Autriche.

L’interprétation des résultats doit toujours s’appuyer sur le contexte opérationnel : les consignes données aux enquêteur-rices, les conditions de collecte, les scripts utilisés, les journaux d’appels ou de connexion, ainsi que la composition des échantillons attribués. Ces éléments seuls permettent de distinguer une vraie anomalie d’un simple effet de structure ou de calendrier. De plus, les informations mobilisées concernent parfois des données sensibles, tant sur les enquêteur-rices que sur les ménages interrogés ; elles doivent donc être traitées dans le strict respect des règles de confidentialité et de protection des données personnelles en vigueur. En résumé, {vizsurvey} est un outil d’aide à l’analyse, pas un outil de diagnostic automatique.
